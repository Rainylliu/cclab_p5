        <h2>Result 3: Shy and simple person</h2>
       <p>
        You are very kind and don't like complicated human relationships. In the eyes of your friends, you are someone who needs to be taken care of and needs others to make decisions for you. Only those who really know you know that you are a soft person on the outside and a strong person on the inside.
